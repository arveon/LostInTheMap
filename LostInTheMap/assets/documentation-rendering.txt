Renderer:
All objects added individually. Only IDrawable component is passed. All objects stored in their queues (vectors).
Public methods:
add_object_to_queue(IDrawable*) â€“ adds an object to queue
sort_queues() - called every tick to sort the surface and ui object by their y coordinates (objects that are higher on screen are behind). uses bubble sort because it had best best-case complexity (linear)
render_queues() - render everything
prepare_terrain(int map_width, map_height) - map_width and height require size of whole map in pixels
remove_from_terrain(int id, layers layer) - removes an object with specified queue id from the render queue
