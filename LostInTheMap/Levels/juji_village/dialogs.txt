Level2

Level begin:
Leader: Just like it was foretold! A Na'hum appearing from thin air!
Giovanni: Sorry, what? Who are you?
Leader: Don't you worry, my child, we know where you come from. I am Ji'do a D'ho of this village.
Giovanni: A who?
Leader: *gasp* A D'ho, I am a mere guide for my people. I make sure everyone in here is happy.
Giovanni: Where am I? I was just at the excavation site a second ago...
Leader: How interesting... This is a village of the Ju'ji tribe. It was foretold that one of your kind will come and bring salvation to us!
Giovanni: Salvation? What kind of salvation are we talking about? I want to get back to where I was!
Leader: Now now, it is said that you will only be able to return to your kin after you re-assemble the Map of the Lands.
Giovanni: Ok, let's get this over with as soon as possible, where can I find the parts of the map?
Leader: I have one of them, and I will reward you with it in return for helping the village.
Giovanni: If you insist... How can I help your village?
Leader: There is a den of snakes right behind this village. You are to clear it and I will grant you the map. Talk to a guard at the other end of the village, he will tell you more.

V1:
-Wow, where did you come from?

V2:
-What is this you wearing? Is it even comfortable?

V3:
-Why is your skin so pale? Are you a Na'Hum?
-Uhm... What is a Na'Hum?
-Did you just fall from the moon? It's an ancient of weird lands where the water can become hard and fall from the sky. Some say it's always a cold night in there and the sun isn't warm! I think it is stupid, nobody can live like that!

V4:
-It's so interesting to see a Na'Hum. You're not that scary, though!
-Why should I be scary?
-They say your people consider killing a game and hunt for fun, not for survival.
-Well, it lets us blow our steam off, I guess...
-Why not stick a spear in a dummy then? No corpse and the steam's gone...
-If only it was that simple...

GIOVANNI AND THE GUARD:
-Hey, a Na'Hum, I never thought I will see one with my own eyes! I'm Jo'si. How can I help?
-I was told you got problems with snakes up here.
-Yes! Finally someone to deal with it! I would do it myself, but they scare me!
-It's fine, I'll just need a torch, the buggers are afraid of fire...
-I have one here, there you are! Actually...
No, nevermind, you wouldn't do it anyway...
-What's that?
-My son Za'Ji has gone missing! I have a feeling he could have gone to fight snakes, a silly boy! Could you please bring him back if you see him there?
-Sure thing, I will look for him!
-Oh thank you! Na'hum aren't as spiteful and vicious as the legends say after all...

GIOVANNI AND Za'Ji
-Hey, you look like a human, help me out!

AFTER SNAKES ARE KILLED:
-Phew, a bit more time and it would be an end to me!
-Aren't you a bit too young to wander into a snake den alone?
-I'm not just a silly boy! I'm Za'Ji the Young Tiger! Snakes are nothing to me!
-You should run back home, your parents are worried...
-No way! The snakes are still here. I'll help you out!

AFTER QUEEN SNAKE IS KILLED:
-Get it, you tailface queen!
-Good job, Za'Ji
-We saved the village, we are heroes now!

AFTER COMING BACK TO VILLAGE:
-I'll need to run now, tell my da I'm fine. See ya!

COMING BACK TO LEADER:
-Are you done yet?
-Yes, the snakes are no more. Now where's the piece of your map?
-You can have it, you deserve it!
