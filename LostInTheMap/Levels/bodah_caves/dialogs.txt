Level start in the village:
(Gio and Village leader)
-So what's next?
-There are two other map parts that I know of, both belong to people from the cursed Zak'ra tribe.
-Where would I find them?
-Slow your zebras, I suspect they will not part with their parts so easily.
-Why not? It's just a piece of paper after all...
-They are a vicious ruthless tribe. 
It is said that Death once walked in into the hut their D'ho was sleeping in and he traded in his spirit and the whole tribe to rule it forever.
Ever since then they began attacking us without no reason. The war has been going for years now and it is said that one day a Na'Hum will come and end it.
-Are you saying I'm to end your war? Why me? I don't have anything to do with it!
-It is just a twist of fate. You are to go to the caves behind the snakes den. You will find Zur'shi the right hand of Zak'ra D'ho. He has a piece of map. Don't expect warm welcome.


V1:
-You killed all the snakes! Bravo!

V2:
-How did you find the courage to fight facetails? A mere sight of them makes me shiver!

V3:
-Are you to stop the Cursed War? I hope you will succeed!

V4:
-Our myths are certainly wrong about Na'hum people. You don't seem all that bad...


Za'Ji:
-Oh, hello again. I see you are heading to the caves. I'll go with you!
-Isn't it too dangerous? Aren't these Zak'ra people in there?
-It's dangerous, but I'm not afraid! Friends of my Da are held in there. We need to help them!

Zak'ra at the entrance:
-Intruder! Kill him!

C1:
-I escaped, but got lost. Thanks for saving me! I shall help you with the others.

C2:
-Phew, I thought I was done for! There's more of us in the caves!

C3:
-This Zak'ra scum will pay for what they did to me!

C4:
-That was close! My friend is somewhere in this cave, please save him!

C5:
-Thank you, kind stranger, I see you've saved all of us now. Let's end our captor now!


Za'Ji:
-We've done it! Let's go tell everyone about it!
