Level1

Level start dialog:
Supervisor: Come on, Giovanni, don't be afraid to step in, old ruins don't bite!
Giovanni: Ruins don't, but all these rats probably do! Do I have to stay here?
Supervisor: Cut this talk, youngling, we've got work to do.
Supervisor: You are to explore these halls. Report any findings to me directly!


A1:
- I wonder what's behind that door...

A2:
- Hi Gio, haven't seen you in a while? How are things?
- Doing great actually! That's my first actual excavation... It's so exciting to be here!

A3:
- Gosh, this whole excavation is a sinking ship, look at all these rats!
- Yeah, popped out of their holes as soon as we dug this place out...

A4:
-Did you find anything yet? I bet there's a pile of gold hidden somewhere in these chambers...


Lever end dialog:
Supervisor: Now now, be careful don't step on anything precious!
A1: Wow, a hidden chamber! Everything is exactly like in the movies!
A2: I wonder if there is any treasure in there...
Supervisor: Stop this talk right now! Anything you find in there is to be brought to me!

When entered room:
A1: Wow, that is a letdown! No hidden treasure...
A2: Is this a map? On a pedestal? 
A3: Why would anyone build a room to store a single piece of paper in it...
Supervisor: Silence, it might be...


If player tries to talk to supervisor after taking gold
Supervisor: Giovanni! Yes you, stop right there! What's that in your pocket?
Giovanni: Me? It's just a few gold coins I found in one of the rooms.
Supervisor: Hand them to me immediately, I need to record them!
