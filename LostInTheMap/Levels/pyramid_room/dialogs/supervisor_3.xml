	<rep character="1" text="Finally! An interesting find! All these graduates probably think it's a lame piece of parchment!" />
	<rep character="0" text="Well, it does look like a boring piece of parchment, if I'm honest..." />
	<rep character="1" text="So what? It's not what it's made of that's important. It's what's on it and why they placed it here." />
	<rep character="0" text="And do you have any idea why?" />
	<rep character="1" text="Look at these symbols on the wall around pedestal. They represent Ar'Dha - one of the Ju'ji gods." />
	<rep character="1" text="I have spent my whole life researching this tribe and usually they place these symbols to seal objects that bear a curse so that they would not harm people." />
	<rep character="1" text="The mere fact that they designated a whole hidden room for the map means that they beileved the curse was extremely dangerous even when sealed." />
	<rep character="1" text="As for me, I don't believe in magical curses, I'm itching to get my hands on this artifact." />
	<rep character="0" text="Let's take it and get out of here, I don't think there is anything else interesting in these ruins..." />
